This documentation shows the different navigation commands the user can enter
to observe the execution of the SAT solver.

The commands are the following:
    ********************************* HELPERS *********************************
    help
        Print this helper

    ******************************** NAVIGATION *******************************
    `enter key` or next
        Advances in the execution until the next notification with a level lower
        than the `display level`

    b or back
        Goes backward in the execution until the next notification with a level
        lower than the `display level`

    set level <level>
        Sets the `display level` to <level>

    ******************************* OBSERVATION *******************************
    sort clauses
        Sorts the literals in the display by their status (satisfied/undefined/
        falsified)

    p or print
        Prints the state of the observer.

    ******************************* WATCH POINTS ******************************
    mark var <variable>
        Marks the variable <variable>.
        All notifications involving marked variables have a level 1 (`display
        level`)
        <variable> should be a positive integer between 0 and the number of
        variables in the solver

    mark clause <cl>
        Marks the clause <cl>.
        All notifications involving marked variables a have a level 1 (`display
        level`)
        <cl> should be a positive integer

    unmark var <variable>
        Removes the variable <var> from the marked variables.

    unmark clause <cl>
        Removes the clause <cl> from the marked clauses.

    set breakpoint <bp>
        Sets a new breakpoing <bp>
        The notification number <bp> will be assigned level 1 (`display level`)

    remove breakpoint <bp>
        Removes the breakpoint <bp>

    ***************************** LATEX GENERATION ****************************
    save
        Saves the clause set and trail as LaTeX tikz figures in the files
        that were configured by the --save option (see "$ NapSAT -h")

    print trail latex [file name]
        Prints the LaTeX code for the trail as a tikz picture on the standard
        ouput.
        If [file name] is a valid location, the trail is saved as a file called
        [file name] instead.

    print clauses latex [file name]
        Prints the LaTeX code of the clauses as a tabular on the standard output.
        If [file name] is a valid location, the clauses is saved as a file called
        [file name] instead.

    print implications latex [file name]
        Prints the LaTeX code of the implication graph as a tikz picture on the
        standard output.
        If [file name] is a valid location, the implication graph is saved as a
        file called [file name] instead.
