When the solver is in `interactive` mode (-i or --interactive), it will ask
the user to enter a command between decisions. These commands take the following
form

  - HELP
    Prints this helper file.

  - "empty command"
    The solver makes an arbitrary decision. If no decision can be made, the solver returns.

  - DECIDE [lit]
    If [lit] is not provided, performs an arbitrary decision.
    [lit] should be undefined.
    Pushes [lit] as a new decision on the trail

  - HINT <lit> <reason> /!\ Not yet implemented
    <lit> should be undefined.
    Add a theory propagation to the trail

  - LEARN [lit0] [lit1] [...] [litn]
    Adds the clause lit0 V lit1 V .. V litn to the clause set

  - EXIT
    Kills the program

  - PRINT <trail/trail-simple/clause-set/watch-lists>
    Prints to the terminal
      trail: The trail in a linear format with the level and reason of each
        literal
      trail-simple: The trail in a flatten format. More compact, does not show
        the reasons.
      clause-set: The set of clauses that are still active (not deleted)
      watch-lists: The watch lists for each literal.

  - DELETE_CLAUSE <clause_number> /!\ Probably buggy, not tested much
    Deletes a clause from the clause set.
