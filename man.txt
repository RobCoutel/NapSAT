This modulariT-SAT is a CDCL SAT solver supporting both chronological and non-chronological backtracking. The solver will print "s SATISFIABLE" if the problem has a solution, and "s UNSATISFIABLE" otherwise.

To use the solver, use the following command:
    modulariT-SAT[-dbg] <input_file> [options]

The options are the following:
    -cb or --chronological-backtracking :
        Use chronological backtracking

    -i or --interactive [command file] :
        Set the mode of solving to interactive, i.e., the solver can be commanded between decisions.
        If [command file] is a valid file name and does not start with the character '-', each line of the file will serve as commands until it reaches the end.

    -o or -observing :
        Set the mode of the solver to observing, i.e., the solver will send notifications to an observer which will display the advancement of the solver.
