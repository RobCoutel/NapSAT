modulariT-SAT is a CDCL SAT solver supporting both chronological and non-chrono-
logical backtracking. The solver will print "s SATISFIABLE" if the problem has a
solution, and "s UNSATISFIABLE" otherwise.

To use the solver, use the following command:
    modulariT-SAT-<version>[-dbg] <input_file/-h/-hs/-hn> [options]

The options are the following:
*********************************** HELPERS ************************************
  -h or --help
    Print this helper

  -hs or --help-sat-commands
    Print the documentation of SAT commands the interactive solver supports

  -hn or --help-navigation
    Print the documentation of the navigation commands the observer supports

******************************* SOLVER BEHAVIOR *******************************
  -cb or --chronological-backtracking
    Enables the solver to use chronological backtracking.

  -scb or --strong-chronological-backtracking
    Enables  the solver to use strong chronological  backtracking.  That is, the
    solver will use the lazy reimplication scheme.

  -rscb or --restoring-chronological-backtracking
    Enables  the solver to use restoring  chronological  backtracking.  That is,
    the solver will repropagated literals that moved during backtacking.

  -del or --delete-clauses
    Enables the solver to delete learned clauses.

*********************************** OBSERVER ***********************************
  -sw or --suppress-warning
    If true, the observer will not print warnings.
    Requires: observing, interactive, check_invariants or print_stats is on

  -i or --interactive
    Sets the solver to interractive  mode. Before each decision, the solver will
    wait for the user to enter a command before continuing.

  -o or --observing
    Sets an observer  to the solver. The observer will print information  about
    the solver.

  -c or --check-invariants
    Enables the solver to check some invariants through the observers.

  -stat or --print-stats
    Enables the observer to print statistics at the end of the execution.
    Requires: observing or interactive is on

  -commands or --commands-file <string = "">
    File containing the commands to be executed by the solver.
    Requires: interactive is on

  -s or --save-folder <string = "">
    Folder  where  the solver  will save the LaTeX  files.  (see $ modulariT-SAT
    --help-navigation for more information)

****************************** VARIABLE ACTIVITY ******************************
  --var-activity-decay <double = 0.95>
    Decay factor of the _var_activity_increment.
    Requires: 0 < decay < 1

******************************* CLAUSE DELETION *******************************
  --clause-elimination-multiplier <double = 1.5>
    Multiplier of the number of clauses before elimination. When the
    simplifying  procedure is called to eliminate clauses, the new threshold for
    deletion is multiplied by this multiplier.
    Requires: multiplier > 1

  --clause-activity-multiplier <double = 1.001>
    Multiplier for the activity increment of clauses. The higher the
    multiplier, faster the clauses are considered irrelevant.
    Requires: The multiplier must be greater than 1.

  --clause-activity-threshold-decay <double = 0.85>
    Decay factor  of the clause activity  threshold.  If the solver deletes  too
    many clauses,  the solver will not make progress.  Therefore,  the threshold
    is multiplied  by the threshold decay factor upon each clause deletion. This
    hyper parameter must be set to a value lower than 1.
    Requires: 0 < decay < 1

*********************************** RESTARTS ***********************************
  --agility-decay <double = 0.9999>
    Decay factor the of moving average of the agility.
    Requires: 0 < decay < 1

  --agility-threshold <double = 0.4>
    Threshold  of the agility.  If the agility is lower than the threshold,  the
    solver restarts and the the threshold is multiplied by
    agility_threshold_decay.
    Requires: 0 < threshold < 1

  --threshold-multiplier <double = 1>
    Multiplier  for the agility threshold. Since formulas can be very different,
    the agility  for one problem  may not be the same as the agility for another
    problem. Therefore,  the threshold is multiplied by the threshold multiplier
    upon each implication.  This hyper parameter  must be set to a value greater
    than 1.
    Requires: multiplier >= 1

  --agility-threshold-decay <double = 1>
    Decay factor of the threshold.  If the solver restarts too often, the solver
    will  not  make  progress.  Therefore,  the threshold  is multiplied  by the
    threshold  decay factor upon each restart. This hyper parameter  must be set
    to a value lower than 1 and lower than 2 - threshold_multiplier.
    Requires: 0 < decay < 1
