# modulariT SAT solver

## Description

This git contains the SAT solver of a modular SMT Solver called modulariT. ModulariT is a project lead by Pr. Pascal Fontaine and whose goal is to create a modular SMT Solver in C++ for academic and research purposes.

This SAT solver is inspired by the MiniSAT but (will) support incremental solving, hints and other useful features for SMT solving.

The solver was written by Robin Coutelier as a follow-up to his master thesis on "Chronological vs. Non-Chronological Backtracking in SMT Solving" and is currently work in progress. It was partially written while working at the University of Liège, Belgium, and the project is still ongoing at the TU Wien, Austria (as of 2024) under the supervision of Pr. Laura Kovács.

The goal of this project is to create a flexible SAT solver that implements both chronological and non-chronological backtracking while still supporting standard SMT features such as incremental solving, hints, etc.

The solver also implements an observer pattern that allow easy debugging, and automatic tikz graph generation for the trail, the clause set and the implication graph. This is useful for understanding the history of the bug, and generating slides for presentations.

### Contributions

This solver brings the contribution of Lazy Strong Chronological Backtracking. A method used to enforce stronger invariants to chronological backtracking, and to reduce the number of propagations while never missing unit implications. A paper on this topic is currently being written and will be submitted to SAT 2024.

## Installation

### Building

The project uses CMake to generate the build files. To build the project, simply run the following commands:

```bash {"id":"01HRQ2SDACEHDTX86EN4FH6562"}
make
```

This will generate the build files and compile the project. The executable will be located in the build folder.

A debug version can be generated by running the following commands:

```bash {"id":"01HRQ2SDAD54CFP30XNWJG3DDN"}
make debug
```

This will generate the build files and compile the project with debug flags. The executable will be located in the build folder. In debug mode, the executable will be named `modulariT-SAT-*version*-dbg`. This executable aggressively checks for invariant violations and will be much slower than the release version.

## Usage

Building the project will generate two executables in the build folder: `modulariT-SAT-*version*` and `test-SAT`. The first one is the SAT solver itself and the second one is the unit tests executable. The unit tests are not very elaborate at the moment, and will be improved in the future.

### Running the SAT solver

The SAT solver can be run with the following command:

```bash {"id":"01HRQ2SDAD54CFP30XP0A14826"}
./modulariT-SAT-*version*[-dbg] <input-file> [options]
```

The input file must be a valid DIMACS CNF file. The solver will then try to solve the given formula and print the result on the standard output.

### Function calls

TODO (when the API is more clearly defined)

## List of objectives for the future

- The display is currently only in the form of terminal output. The goal is to create a nice user interface for the solver, and to allow naming of variables and clauses, and to display the implication graph in a more user-friendly way. This is left for future work.
- The solver currently only supports the DIMACS CNF format. We would like to add support for any arbitrary propositional formula in the future.
- The solver does not support proof generation yet. This is a feature that is planned for the future.
- The solver does not support theory propagations yet.
- The solver does not support user propagation yet.
- The solver does not support additional theories. We would like to add AMO constraints, and be flexible enough to be easily hackable and add other simple theories.
- The solver does not support assumptions yet.
- The solver does not provide unsat cores yet.
- We intend on improving cache friendliness and memory usage in the future.
