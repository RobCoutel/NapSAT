# modulariT SAT solver
## Description
This git contains the SAT solver of a modular SMT Solver called modulariT. ModulariT is a project lead by Pr. Pascal Fontaine and whose goal is to create a modular SMT Solver in C++ for academic and research purposes.

This SAT solver is inspired by the MiniSAT but (will) support incremental solving, hints and other useful features for SMT solving.

The solver was written by Robin Coutelier as a follow-up to his master thesis on "Chronological vs. Non-Chronological Backtracking in SMT Solving" and is currently work in progress.

The goal of this project is to create a flexible SAT solver that implements both chronological and non-chronological backtracking while still supporting standard SMT features such as incremental solving, hints, etc.

## Installation
### Building
The project uses CMake to generate the build files. To build the project, simply run the following commands:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the build files and compile the project. The executable will be located in the build folder.

A debug version can be generated by running the following commands:
```bash
make debug
```
This will generate the build files and compile the project with debug flags. The executable will be located in the build folder. In debug mode, the executable will be named `modulariT-SAT-dbg`. This executable aggressively checks for invariant violations and will be much slower than the release version.

### Options
A few compilation options are available. For the time being, they must be modified in the `src/SAT-config.hpp` file. The following options are available:
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The log level of the solver. The higher the level, the more verbose the solver will be. The default value is 0.
- `STATS`: Whether or not to collect statistics about the solving process. The default value is 0.
- `DEBUG_CLAUSE`: If this option is enabled, the solver will print information about the clause whose ID is equal to the value of `DEBUG_CLAUSE`. The default value is 0 (prints nothing).

## Usage
Building the project will generate two executables in the build folder: `modulariT-SAT` and `test-SAT`. The first one is the SAT solver itself and the second one is the unit tests executable.

### Running the SAT solver
The SAT solver can be run with the following command:
```bash
./modulariT-SAT <input-file>
```
The input file must be a valid DIMACS CNF file. The solver will then try to solve the given formula and print the result on the standard output.

### Function calls
TODO (when the API is more clearly defined)
